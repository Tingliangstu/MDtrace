MDtrace 1.1.0 is an SED-focused toolkit for extracting eigenvector-free,
kinetic-energy-weighted phonon spectra from molecular-dynamics trajectories.
It computes and visualizes total or element/direction-resolved spectral energy
density (SED) and performs independent Lorentzian or velocity-DHO peak fitting.

Dynamic structure factor (DSF) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)
are planned extensions; they are not part of the supported 1.1.0 workflow.

## Highlights

- Builds exact wave vectors commensurate with a finite MD supercell.
- Reads GPUMD extended XYZ, one-file LAMMPS custom dumps, and compatible
  NetCDF trajectories through one block-oriented interface.
- Either streams text directly once or converts it to a reusable
  `.mdtrace.nc` cache; optional one-block prefetch overlaps I/O with SED work.
- Computes SED with serial NumPy, multiprocessing NumPy, or one optional CuPy
  GPU backend.
- Writes total and element/Cartesian-resolved SED in `eV/THz`.
- Produces phonon-dispersion maps and logarithmic single-Q spectra.
- Detects peaks with a local, dimensionless noise-significance criterion.
- Fits every peak independently with a zero-background Lorentz or
  velocity-spectrum DHO line shape; `auto` selects between them using AICc.
- Exports per-Q and combined frequency-lifetime data plus a summary figure.

The documentation selector exposes two public versions after release:
`latest` follows the `main` branch, while `1.1.0` is the frozen manual built
from the matching Git tag. Use the tagged manual when reproducing a released
calculation. Read the Docs may additionally expose `stable` as an alias for
the newest stable tag; it is not a third independently maintained manual.

## Installation

MDtrace 1.1.0 requires Python 3.10 or newer. Install the current source with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tingliangstu/MDtrace.git mdtrace
cd mdtrace
python -m pip install .
mdtrace -h
```

The default NumPy backend does not require CUDA. For GPU SED computation,
install exactly one CuPy wheel matching the CUDA major version available on the
machine:

```bash
# Choose one; do not install both.
python -m pip install cupy-cuda12x
python -m pip install cupy-cuda13x
```

Then set:

```ini
backend = cupy
```

MDtrace uses one GPU per process. Peak detection and line-shape fitting remain
SciPy CPU operations.

## Command line

```bash
mdtrace                  # input.in, then the legacy input_SED.in
mdtrace input.in         # explicit input file
mdtrace -h               # command summary
```

The calculation is controlled inside the input file:

```ini
action = thinking        # run the next missing SED stage
method = sed             # supported 1.1.0 method
backend = numpy          # numpy or cupy
```

For an explicit and reproducible workflow, use the same `input.in` and change
only `action`:

1. `action = compute` — read the trajectory and overwrite the numerical SED.
2. `action = plot` — plot existing `.SED`, `.Qpts`, and `.THz` files.
3. `action = fit` — detect and fit peaks in existing SED data.

`thinking` mode is a convenience that checks existing outputs and runs the
next missing stage. MDtrace resolves relative trajectory and `basis.in` paths
relative to the input file, so the command may be launched from another
directory. Relative output prefixes and the `Fitting-Qpoint/` and `Lifetime/`
directories are written relative to the current working directory.

For spectral fitting in `thinking` mode, `lorentz_fit_all_qpoint = 1` fits all
Q points when the combined lifetime file is missing. If the parameter is
omitted or set to `0`, MDtrace fits only the zero-based Q point selected by
`qpoint_slice_index` when that Q-point lifetime file is missing. Existing
output is treated as complete; use `action = fit` to force a refit after
changing fitting parameters.

## Complete single-Q refit example

The following SrTiO3 input refits zero-based Q-point `23` after an earlier
all-Q fit. It assumes that `SrTiO3.SED`, `SrTiO3.Qpts`, `SrTiO3.THz`, and the
existing per-Q files under `Lifetime/` are already present. After replacing the
Q-point result, `re_output_total_freq_lifetime = 1` rebuilds the combined file
and the frequency-lifetime figure.

```ini
# ==================== Control ====================
action      = fit       # fit existing SED data
method      = SED
backend     = cupy      # affects compute; fitting itself uses SciPy on CPU

# ==================== MD simulation ====================
num_atoms          = 40000

# ==================== SED plot ====================

plot_cutoff_freq   = 25.0
plot_interval      = 5.0
qpoint_slice_index = 23       # zero-based index
plot_slice         = 1
if_show_figures    = 0        # save without opening an interactive window
# colorbar_min     = -20      # optional natural-log color limits
# colorbar_max     = -2

# ==================== Spectral fitting ====================
lorentz_fit_all_qpoint        = 0
lorentz_fit_freq_min          = 0
lorentz_fit_freq_max          = 25
peak_min_significance         = 5.0
fitting_function              = auto   # auto | lorentz | dho
initial_guess_hwhm            = 0.01
re_output_total_freq_lifetime = 1      # rebuild existing all-Q results
```

Run it with:

```bash
mdtrace input.in
```

For the initial all-Q fit, first use:

```ini
action                           = fit
lorentz_fit_all_qpoint           = 1
re_output_total_freq_lifetime    = 0  # all-Q fitting rebuilds the summary automatically
```

Inspect the figures under `Fitting-Qpoint/` before treating the collected
linewidths as reliable.

## Compute backends

| Configuration | SED execution |
|---|---|
| `backend = numpy`, `max_cores = 1` | Serial NumPy |
| `backend = numpy`, `max_cores > 1` | Persistent CPU workers sharing each velocity block |
| `backend = cupy` | One GPU per MDtrace process |

`num_blocks` controls spectral averaging and the amount of trajectory data
loaded per block. The requested number of saved frames must be divisible by
`num_blocks`.

## Main outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `<name>.SED` | Total kinetic-energy-weighted SED in `eV/THz` |
| `<name>.Qpts` | Reduced Q-point coordinates |
| `<name>.THz` | Ordinary-frequency axis in THz |
| `<name>.Q_distances_and_labels` | Path distances and high-symmetry labels |
| `<name>-SED.png` | SED dispersion map |
| `SED-<q>-qpoint.png` | Optional single-Q SED plot |
| `<name>_partial_SED/` | Optional element/Cartesian SED files and figures |
| `Fitting-Qpoint/Fitting-<q>-qpoint.png` | Per-Q fitted line shapes |
| `Lifetime/Fitting-<q>-qpoint.Fre_lifetime` | Two-column fitted frequency (THz) and `tau_SED` (ps) for one Q point |
| `Lifetime/Fitting-All-Qpoints.Fre_lifetime` | The same two columns concatenated over all Q points; no Q-index column |
| `Fitting-Frequency-Lifetime.png` | All-Q frequency-lifetime summary |

For a selected partial SED component, `Fitting-Frequency-Lifetime.png` is
stored under `<name>_partial_SED/`. The numbered fitting figures and lifetime
tables still use the shared `Fitting-Qpoint/` and `Lifetime/` directories, so
save or move an existing total-SED fit before fitting a partial component if
both results must be retained.

## Interpreting fitted lifetimes

MDtrace reports the linewidth-derived convention

```text
tau_SED = 1 / (2*pi*HWHM)
```

with HWHM in THz and `tau_SED` in ps. For isolated, underdamped peaks this is
the conventional SED linewidth lifetime. Overlapping, incomplete, critically
damped, and overdamped features should be interpreted qualitatively. In
strongly anharmonic systems, always inspect the fitted line shape and compare
only calculations with consistent trajectory length, frequency resolution,
Q grid, and fitting settings.

## Roadmap

The 1.1.0 release deliberately focuses on a clean SED workflow. Planned work
includes:

- dynamic structure factor (DSF),
- electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS),
- optional mode-projected SED using external eigenvectors.

Roadmap items are not part of the supported 1.1.0 command interface.
